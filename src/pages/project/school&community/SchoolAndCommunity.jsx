      <h1>SCHOOL & COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</h1>
      <h2>BEHAVIOURAL TRANSFORMATION (SCHOOL LEADERSHIP)</h2>
      <p className="italic-blue">
        Under this programme, we work with both government and private schools
        and with their support, we provide capacity-building training and
        workshops to strengthen the skills of their school teachers. The aim of
        this programme is to ensure the accessibility of quality education to
        every child.

      <h2>BEHAVIOURAL TRANSFORMATION (COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP)</h2>
      <p className="italic-blue">
        Under this programme, we interact and motivate community people to take
        an active part in school activities. We advocate for "gaon ka school"
        instead of "gaon mein school." We advocate for community people that
        education is very important for self and community development; hence,
        just sending their children to school is not enough. In addition, they
        must take an active part in school activities and take the
        responsibility to make their school the best in terms of quality of
        education and a safe & conducive environment of learning for every
        child.{" "}

      <h2>INFRASTRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION</h2>
      <p className="italic-blue">
        With the support of government, schools & community stakeholders, we
        advocate and support schools and communities to create a safe learning
        space for every child. It includes the setting-up library, BaLA
        (Building as Learning Aid) paintings in schools, sports, smart classes
        to mitigate the digital divide and to make learning innovative & fun,
        and play station to make learning joyful.{" "}
