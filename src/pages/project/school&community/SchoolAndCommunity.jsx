      <p className="italic-blue">
      In this initiative, we collaborate with both public and private educational institutions, partnering with them to extend infrastructural support in schools and provide capacity-building training/workshops that enhance the capabilities of teachers and their instructional practices. The primary objective of this program is to increase the learning outcomes of children with the active involvement of teachers and parents/caregivers in a child-friendly environment. Under this initiative, we are currently supporting more than 5,000 children from Mirzapur (U.P), Churu (Rajasthan), and Korba (Chhattisgarh).
