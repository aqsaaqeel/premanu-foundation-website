        Early Childhood Development (ECD) (The early moments matter a lot for
        every child to reach their full potential. One in every three children
        under five years of age does not reach their developmental potential.) ​
        Early childhood (0–8 years), particularly the period from conception to
        age 3, is the most remarkable era of growth and development in a child's
        lifespan. The brain grows faster than at any other time during this
        period, and 80% of a baby's brain is developed by this age. A baby's
        brain development affects their physical, intellectual, and emotional
        well-being, learning potential, and, as a result, earning capacity and
        success in adulthood. ​
      </p>
      <p className="education-content">
        For healthy brain development in these years, children need a safe,
        secure, and loving environment with the right nutrition and stimulation
        from their parents or caregivers. This is a window of opportunity to lay
        a foundation of health and well-being whose benefits last a lifetime –
        and carry into the next generation ​
      </p>
      <p className="italic-blue">
        Over 43% of children under the age of five are at risk of not fulfilling
        their full developmental potential.

      <p className="education-content">
        The early childhood period encompasses several quite distinct phases:
        from ‘conception to birth’ and from ‘birth to 3 years, with emphasis on
        the first 1,000 days (from conception to 24 months), followed by the
        ‘preschool and pre-primary years (3 years to the age of school entry).{" "}

      <p className="italic-blue">
        The goal of ECD is that all young children, especially the most
        vulnerable, from conception to the age of school entry, reach their full
        developmental potential.
