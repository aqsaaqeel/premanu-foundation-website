        One in four children of school-going age is out of school in India
        (Census, 2011), and out of every 100 children, only 32 children finish
        their school education age-appropriately (DISE 2014-15). Considering the
        issue of education in underprivileged society, we are trying to reach
        the last child so that no child is left behind. We believe that every
        child, irrespective of gender, caste, class, religion, race, and
        ethnicity deserves access to basic quality education. Since the
        beginning of our journey in 2019, we have helped more than 9000 children
        through various interventions.
