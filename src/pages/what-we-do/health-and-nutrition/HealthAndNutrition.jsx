        One in two children below 5 years of age is anaemic, and one in three
        children are stunted as well underweight in the country. Further, 34
        children in every 100 children die before completing their 1st birthday
        (SRS, 2018). These statistics are alarming and seek our attention to
        ensure that every child lives a healthy life.
