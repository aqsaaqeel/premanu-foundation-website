        Family is the first social institution where a child grows, learns, and
        socializes. Therefore, it is important that family members give enough
        time to their children and ensure a safe childhood. It will not be
        possible if the family is going through any financial stress. Therefore,
        we are working with the family units also to help them find appropriate
        livelihood opportunities.
